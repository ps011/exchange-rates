## Currency Exchange Rates

This is a nextjs based application to convert one currency into another using the `currencyapi`. I created this application to convert currencies when I'm traveling abroad and need something handy, fast, and easy to convert currencies.

### Features (MVP)

- Select currencies
- Set source currency and get a corresponding value in destination currency
- Add the last updated time for currency rates

### Planned Features

- Add Header and Footer
- Add animations
- Add Dark Mode


### Setups

In order to setup the repository on local system. You will need only one thing, an account on `https://currencyapi.net/`.

- Create an account on currencyapi.net
- Get the API key
- Rename .env.example to .env
- Replace the value of API_KEY with your API key.
